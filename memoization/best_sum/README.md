# howSum
Write a function `bestSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a target sum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of elements that add up to exactly the target sum. If there is no combination that adds up, then return null.

If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of them.

You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.

You may assume that all input numbers are nonnegative.

```
howSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]) -> [7]
howSum(0, [1, 2, 3]) -> []
```
